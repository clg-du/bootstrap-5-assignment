#'
#' ## Overview
#'
#' In this assignment, you will be working with a pre-built HTML template of a
#' website that uses Bootstrap 5 to promote a fictional course. 
#' 
#' Your task is to customize the template by adding content, styling, and
#' functionality to create a unique and engaging webpage that showcases the
#' course. You will be required to add certain elements to the template, such as
#' text, images, buttons, and navigation links, and modify the existing styles
#' to match the theme of the course.
#' 
#' You will also be required to make sure that certain classes are restored so
#' as to resolve issues where functionality is broken.
#' 
#' Assignment details and minimum requirements to pass are outlined below. You
#' may use this project style or syntax as inspiration for your own projects.
#'
#' ## Assignment Details
#' 
#' - **Title:** Customizing a Bootstrap 5 Website
#' 
#' - **Objective:** To customize a pre-built HTML template using Bootstrap 5
#' 
#' - **Requirements:** You will need to add content, styling, and functionality
#' 
#' - **Submission:** You will submit a .zip file containing the modified HTML
#'   file
#' 
#' ## Getting started
#' 
#' 1. Clone the repository containing the pre-built HTML template or download
#'    the .zip file.
#' 
#' 2. Extract the contents of the .zip file to a local directory on your
#'    computer or make a local copy of the repository using Git.
#'
#' 3. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor or code editor of your choice.
#'
#' - **Important note**: You will exclusively work with the `index.html` file.
#'    Do not modify any other files in the template. If you want to "play
#'    around" with the template, such as the .css or .scss files, make a copy of
#'    the project and work on that copy in parallel or use it for reference in
#'    your own projects. For the purpose of this assignment, further broken
#'    functionality should be avoided by maintaining current styles.
#' 
#' 4. Customize the template by adding content, styling, and functionality to
#'   create a unique and engaging webpage that showcases the course. The minimum
#'   requirements to pass the assignment are laid out in the next section.
#' 
#' - **Important note**: Add comments, e.g., `<!-- Your content here -->`, to
#'  indicate where you have made changes or added new elements to the template.
#' 
#' 5. Once you have completed customizing the template, save the `index.html`
#' 
#' 6. Create a ZIP file containing the `index.html` file only. Do not include
#'   any other files in the ZIP file.
#' 
#' 7. Submit the ZIP file to the assignment platform for evaluation.
#' 
#' ## Minimum Requirements to pass assignment
#' 
#' - **Headers**: The template seems a bit tame, so make sure to add some
#'  headers to the page. Add headers using bootstrap classes, not simply adding
#'  h1, h2, etc. tags.
#' 
#' - **Icons**: Add some icons to the page. You can use Bootstrap icons are
#' activated in the template, chose the ones that best fit the theme of the
#' course and add them to parts of the page which seems reasonable.
#' 
#' - **Cards**: The cards seems a bit... off? Make sure to add some proper card
#' classes to the cards to make them look better.
#' 
#' - **Buttons**: The buttons are a bit boring. Add some classes to the buttons
#' to make them look more interesting. Also, make sure you can actually identify
#' them as actual buttons!
#' 
#' - **Accordion**: The accordion looks decent, but why are they not
#' interactive? Make sure to add the correct classes to make sure only one
#' accordion is open at a time when clicked.
#' 
#' - **List Group**: I am of the opinion that the review section would benefit
#' from a list group. Add a list group to the review section, with proper
#' implementation.
#' 
#' - **Modals**: In the end of the document you will find a section to get the
#' latest updates. This sections looks AWFUL! Add a modal to the section to make
#' it look better and add some interactivity. Please note that given that more
#' divs will not be needed, work with what you have.
#' 
#' - **Offcanvas**: The button "Check my other courses" is meant to open an
#' offcanvas. If you inspect the HTML you will see that the offcanvas is already
#' there, but it is not working. You will find the offcanvas at the end of the
#' document. Make sure to add the correct classes to the button to make it work,
#' as well.
#' 
#' ## Grading Criteria
#' 
#' - 6 out of 8 requirements is expected to be met adaquately, in order to pass
#'   the assignment.
#' 
#' - The assignment will be graded based on the completion of the minimum
#'   requirements, and quality of implementation will dictate whether an certain
#'   requirement is met.
#' 
#' - Comments will be provided upon completion of the assignment, detailing
#'   which requirements were met and which were not.
